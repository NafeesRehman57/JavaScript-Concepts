What is Javascript?
JavaScript is a programming language that is commonly used to add interactivity and functionality to websites.
It is a client-side language, which means that it is executed on the user's computer, rather than on a server.
JavaScript is often used in combination with HTML and CSS to create dynamic and interactive websites.
It is also used in the development of server-side applications, mobile apps, and desktop applications.
